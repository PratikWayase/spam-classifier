# Spam Detection Machine Learning Model

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model that can effectively detect spam messages. The model is trained on a dataset of emails and text messages, and it can be used to classify new messages as either spam or not spam.

## Key Features

Employs machine learning techniques to accurately identify spam.
Handles both email and text message spam.
Can be customized for specific use cases.


## Intended Use Cases

Email spam filtering for personal or corporate inboxes.
Text message spam filtering for mobile devices.
Spam detection within social media platforms.
Integration into custom applications to prevent spam.

## Classify a message:

message = "Congratulations! You've won a free vacation!"
is_spam = model.predict(message)

if is_spam:
    print("This message is likely spam.")
else:
    print("This message is likely not spam.")
